Web Browser Extension for Youtube News/Videos

Our browser extension acts as an intelligent overlay for YouTube. It uses Twelve Labs' Pegasus model to perform native video analysis—identifying exactly what is happening in the frames and audio. It then uses Gemini to analyze community sentiment through comments and fact-check claims against external data. Users get a "Credibility Score," a "Clickbait Meter," and a breakdown of Key Claims and thier Validity, Sentiments, Truthfulness, etc
